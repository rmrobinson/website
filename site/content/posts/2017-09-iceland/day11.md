The last day of the trip. We awoke on our own schedules, showered and finished packing. While I was getting ready Kate and Dave had already grabbed themselves breakfast, so once Susan and Chris were up and showered we ventured out to grab a bite to eat. We ended up going to a Dunkin' Donuts, of all places, since not many breakfast restaurants were open. We had a quick breakfast, then walked around Reykjavik a bit to get some fresh air. Chris, Susan, and I were all on the same flight back to Toronto, scheduled to depart at 3:20 PM, so we were not in a big hurry.

We eventually ended up back at Hallgrimskirkja, where we had parked the car. Our guesthouse did not have parking included, however you can park for free overnight at Hallgrimskirkja, so I had taken the car here the previous evening. We were relived to find the car hadn't been towed. We drove back to the guesthouse, packed in all of our bags, then departed for Keflavik just after 11 AM.

We made it to the airport just after noon, with plenty of time before our flights. When we returned the car it had 24,239 km on the odometer; when we picked up the car it had 21,696 km. In the past 11 days, we managed to put 2,543 km on the car - an impressive distance!

We checked into our WOWAir flights without issue, had a quick lunch in the terminal, then said goodbye to Kate and Dave. Their flight was 2 hours after ours, so they decided to stay in the main part of the terminal until they were closer to departure time.

We boarded our flight without incident; on the gangway I noticed that our plane was named Freyja. WOW takes a [lighthearted approach](https://wowair.us/about-us/wow-aircraft/meet-the-wow-fleet/) when issuing registration names to their planes, however TF-MOM (the plane we flew back to Toronto on) is one of only two with an official name.

The flight was uneventful. The route took us over Greenland, and the pilot was kind enough to inform us when we were getting close. Once we were over Greenland he rolled the plane slightly to either side in order to give us better view of Greenland. We landed safely, retrieved our bags with only a short delay then bid farewell to Chris and Susan. It was a fantastic trip with a fantastic group of people!
