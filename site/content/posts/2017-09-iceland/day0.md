The beginning of the trip began at Pearson International airport late in the afternoon. I was meeting Kate, Dave, Chris and Susan in Iceland, so I drove up to their airport on my own. I left Kitchener just before 3 PM, and luckily traffic was reasonably light so I was able to be parked at the Park 'N Fly Economy lot shortly after 4 PM. I had checked in online, but I still had to line up to drop off my bag at the WOWAir counter in Terminal 3, but the line wasn't very long. It looked like most people there were going to be my seatmates on the flight to Iceland, as there was only one WOWAir flight being handled at the baggage counter.

Security was a breeze, and shortly after 5 PM I was standing in the Terminal 3 food court deciding what I was going to have for dinner. WOWAir markets themselves as a discount carrier without any frills, so there was not going to be food served on the plane. I chose to have a burrito, which was decent. Since it was a vacation, I splurged and ordered the guacamole. Boarding started right at 6 PM, which seemed early, but it worked well and everyone was on the plane ahead of our 7 PM departure time. The plane took off from what felt like one of the farthest runways at Pearson; we drove well past the de-icing area in order to reach the runway.

Once in the air the flight was uneventful; my original seatmaes were travelling with others and swapped with a man who had an empty seat beside him, so luckily I had some extra room. The plane was a bit more cramped than I was used to - other carriers flying the A321 tend to leave a bit more leg room between the rows. I planned on spending the entire flight resting, however I was unable to get more than a few minutes of sleep here and there, so when we landed I was feeling pretty tired. The plane landed in Keflav√≠k at around 12:15 AM EDT.
