The trip to Iceland began mid-afternoon on Tuesday, September 19, 2017. The flight I was scheduled on, WW214, was scheduled to departed from Pearson at 7 PM, so I went into the office and spent the morning and early afternoon finalizing some work projects. I left the office around 2:30 PM, drove home, quickly changed into more comfortable travelling clothes and packed my bags into the car, and left Kitchener just before 3 PM. Thankfully traffic was reasonably light, and I was able to arrive and park at the Park 'N Fly Economy lot shortly after 4 PM. I had checked in online the night before, but I still had to line up to drop off my bag at the WOWAir counter in Terminal 3. The line was short; there was only one WOWAir flight being handled at the baggage counter. I was meeting Kate, Dave, Chris and Susan in Iceland, so after dropping off my bag I proceeded through security on my own.

The security line moved quickly, and shortly after 5 PM I was standing in the Terminal 3 food court. There wasn't going to be any food provided on the flight, so I had dinner at the food court. There were a few decent choices, and I settled on a burrito. It was alright, nothing fancy. As this was the beginning of a vacation, I splurged and ordered the guacamole. After dinner I filled up my 1L Nalgene water bottle, since WOWAir doesn't even include free water. Boarding started right at 6 PM, which was earlier than most other carriers would have done, but it worked well and everyone was on the plane ahead of our 7 PM departure time. The plane took off from one of the runways farthest from the terminal at Pearson; we drove well past the de-icing area in order to reach the runway.

Once in the air the flight was uneventful. I was originally seated beside a couple who was travelling with friends, however they ended up swapping with another gentleman to be closer to their friends. Luckily the person they swapped with did not have a seatmate, so we ended up having the middle seat open which supplied a bit more room. The seating was more cramped than I was expecting - other carriers flying the A321 tend to leave a bit more leg room between the rows. I planned on spending the entire flight resting, however I was unable to get more than a few minutes of sleep here and there, so when we landed at the Keflav√≠k International Airport at 12:15 AM EDT (4:15 AM local time) I was pretty tired.
