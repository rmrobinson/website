Today was the day that we completed the loop of Iceland. We got up and left the hotel just before 10 AM. We grabbed a quick breakfast at the Geirabakari Kaffihus on the edge of town. We only had one sight to see day, so after filling up the car with diesel we began the drive out of Borgarnes.

The final sight was a set of waterfalls, and so we drove from Borgarnes to the site of both the [Hraunfossar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hraunfossar) and [Barnafoss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnafossar) waterfalls. We arrived at 11:20 AM, and spent about 30 minutes enjoying the view. It was damp and breezy, but luckily the rain that we had driven through to get to the falls had stopped by the time we were outside. The fall colours were in full display, enhancing the amazing view that these waterfalls offered. Once we had taken enough photos of the scenery we took a photo with the car, which was super dirty after driving through multiple gravel roads. We then loaded into the car for the drive to Reykjavik.

It took us just over 2 hours to drive from the falls to our hotel in Reykjavik. The drive was mostly uneventful, except for the long stretch of unpaved gravel Road 50 we took to avoid going all the way back to the ocean.

Once we checked into the hotel Kate, Dave and I went to find some lunch. We ended up choosing [Mai Thai](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189970-d10373018-Reviews-Mai_Thai-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html), a tasty Thai restaurant located in a Thai grocery store on the north-eastern side of Reykjavik. After lunch we then wandered around downtown Reykjavik with no particular destination in mind. Kate wanted to visit a knitting store, so we made sure to include that in our travels. After several hours we came back to the apartment and relaxed. I updated this blog, and then read a bit.

We went for dinner at 7:30 PM at [Caruso](https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g189970-d691447-Reviews-Caruso-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html), where we had a delicious Italian dinner to finish up the trip. There was a live guitar player serenading the diners, which was a nice touch. The ambience was very cozy, with lit candles on the tables and old wooden tables and chairs. After dinner we wandered around downtown; we walked over to the Harpa Concert Hall and took a quick walk through this fantastic structure. The design of the building was very interesting; there are geometric shapes everywhere. There was no performance going on, so the building was empty; luckily it was still open to the public so we were able to see some of the details up close.

After we finished visiting the music hall we backtracked and went to the Lobster Hut, a night market stall just beside Caruso. Here Susan ordered half a lobster sandwich to share with Chris. They had tried stopping here during their initial visit to Reykjavik, but it were closed at the time. Susan was super excited to get a snack there this time. After this brief stop we walked back to the hotel, where we chatted briefly then packed up and went to bed.
