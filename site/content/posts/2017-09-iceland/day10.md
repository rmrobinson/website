The day that the loop was completed. We got up and left the hotel just before 10 AM. We grabbed a quick breakfast at the Geirabakari Kaffihus at the edge of Borgarnes, then filled up the car with gas. We only had one sight to see day, so after filling up the car we continued on.

We saw one more set of waterfalls, visiting both Hraunfossar and Barnafoss waterfalls. We arrived at 11:20 AM, and spent about 30 minutes enjoying the view. It was damp and breezy, but luckily the rain that we had driven through to get to the falls had stopped by the time we were outside. We took a photo with the car, super dirty after driving through multiple gravel roads, then all loaded into the car for the drive to Reykjavik.

It took us just over 2 hours to drive from the falls to our hotel in Reykjavik. The drive was mostly uneventful, except for the long stretch of unpaved gravel Road 50 we took to avoid going all the way back to the ocean.

Once we checked into the hotel Kate, Dave and I went to find some lunch. We ended up choosing Mai Thai, then wandered around downtown Reykjavik for a bit. Kate wanted to visit a knitting store, which we did for a bit, then came back to the apartment and relaxed. I updated this blog, and then read a bit.

We went for dinner at 7:30 PM at Caruso, where we had a delicious Italian dinner to finish up the trip. There was a live guitar player serenading the diners, which was a nice touch. The ambiance was very cozy, with lit candles on the tables and old wooden tables and chairs. After dinner we wandered around downtown for a bit; we walked to the Harpa Concert Hall and took a quick walk through this fantastic structure. The design of the building was very interesting; with geometric shapes everywhere. There was no performance going on, as the building was empty, but it was still open to the public so we were able to see some of the details up close.

After we finished looking through the music hall we went to the Lobster Hut, where Susan ordered her and Chris a half lobster sandwich to share. They had tried stopping here during their last night in Reykjavik, but they were closed at the time, so she was super excited to get a snack there this time. After this brief stop we walked back to the hotel, where we chatted briefly then packed up and went to bed.
