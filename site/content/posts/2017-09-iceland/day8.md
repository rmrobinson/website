We started our morning a bit later than usual, setting the alarm for 8:00 AM instead of the 7:00 AM that had become standard. We had a long day of driving ahead of us, with not many sites to see, so we decided to get a bit of extra rest. We were up and packed by around 9, then walked to the nearby grocery store to pick up breakfast and lunch. We ate quickly, packed up the car, and left just after 10 AM. Our destination was the west end of the island, near the Þjóðgarðurinn Snæfellsjökull national park.

The drive went well, unfortunately there isn't much to report. We saw a bunch of the northern part of the island, which felt a lot like driving in Alberta. There were a lot of cows being farmed in the first part of the day; with sheep being much less common than in the south. There was a lot of brown flowing grass, as opposed to the mossy green ground cover predominent in the south.
