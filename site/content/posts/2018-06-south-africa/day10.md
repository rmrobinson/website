The ninth day of the tour was the last one with scheduled activities. We had a late 7 AM wake-up call, had breakfast in the hotel and were back in the bus at 8:30 AM. We had a local guide today, who would take us through different parts of Johannesburg and talk to us about the history of the city. Belinda had discovered she had missed my birthday on the bus yesterday, and she decided to make it up to me by treating today as my birthday. It was a coincidence but there was actually another person on the tour whose birthday was June 24, so Belinda announced two birthdays before the bus departed.

We drove from the hotel out to the township of Soweto in the south western part of the city. We drove through the neighbourhood, drove past the Chris Hani-Baragwanath Hospital, drove past the Orlando towers, and then drove to house that Nelson Mandela lived in prior to his imprisonment. The house has been converted into a small museum that has a focus on his and his second wife's life in the house. We spent about a half hour here before continuing on.

Our next stop was at the Hector Pieterson Museum, a short drive from Nelson Mandela's house. This museum commemorated the events of the 1987 Soweto uprising, which started when students marched against being forced to study using the Afrikaans language. The museum was named to commemorate the 12 year old Hector who was one of the first killed in the protest. We visited the memorial outside the museum, then spent about an hour in the museum before continuing on.

Our next stop was the Apartheid museum. We had lunch in the cafe, and started the tour at 12:20. I can't adequately describe the experience of visiting the museum, and can only recommend visiting it for yourself.

The visit to the apartheid museum lasted for two hours, and shortly before 2:30 PM we got back onto the bus for the last time. We returned to the hotel, where we had a drink with our travelling friends. We came back to the room to pack, and we discovered that Belinda had two pieces of red velvet cake delivered to the room with birthday wishes written in icing on the plate. It was a very nice touch. We packed, then went to a final dinner with everyone at 6:30 PM.

This dinner was held at Pigalle, a nice restaurant a block away from the hotel. We were seated at the head of the table with Belinda and the other person celebrating their birthday. Belinda ordered us a bottle of champagne to celebrate, and we had a very nice evening. The dessert was served last to us, as the staff had added sparklers to the plate along with birthday wishes written in icing. It was very enjoyable.

After dinner we went to the hotel bar where we had a farewell drink with our travelling friends, then we went to bed shortly after 11 PM.
