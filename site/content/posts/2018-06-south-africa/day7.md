The sixth day of our tour was my birthday! As a nice change of pace we did not have to get up particularily early - our wake up call was set for 7 AM and the bus did not leave the hotel until 8:30 AM. We were up shortly before 7, had breakfast at the hotel restaurant, and had everything packed up by about 8:15. We got into the bus and drove through the capital of Swaziland, Mbanbane, for a bit. This was a lucky day for us - it was our turn at the front of the bus! <TODO: explain>

The first stop of the day was at a glass factory just outside the capital. This glass factory was established in the mid-80's by some master glassblowers from Europe as a way of bringing some new skills to the area - after a few years the plant was running with a local staff and has been producing hand-made glassware ever since. They use locally sourced recycled glass to construct their items, making it both good for the economy and the environment. We were able to watch the crew creating glasses, vases and small figurines from a catwalk on the second story of the factory, and it reminded Todd and I a lot of the glassblowing class we had taken a couple years earlier. They were obviously much better than us.

After we spent some time watching them constructing the glassware we went into the attached shop and perused through their work. A hanging glass vase caught Todd's eye, and we ended up purchasing it. We will probably convert it into a terrarium or something similar, but that is still up in the air. The vase was not small, but they did a good job packing it up tightly so we are hopeful we can get it home in one piece.

The bus continued on to the South African border crossing. It was about an hour drive, and we got to the border around 12 PM. We cleared immigration without issue, then disembarked the bus. We ate a traditional Swazi lunch, then spent about 2 hours touring through a traditional Swazi village and experienced a series of traditional Swazi dances and songs. The performing group had about a dozen males and about two dozen females dressed in traditional garb, and they did a very impressive job singing and dancing.

We left the border area shortly after 3 PM, and spent the next two hours driving to our hotel in Hazyview. I spent most of the drive reading "Death's End", while Todd alternated between napping and enjoying the view. We arrived to the hotel just after 5 PM, then I spent the hour before dinner working on this blog. The hotel had a nice buffet that we enjoyed with some Australian's on the tour (in fact, the people we had shared the jeep with the previous day). We had a nightcap with them after dinner, then retired to an early bed at 8:30 PM. We were informed of a 4:45 AM wake up call ahead of the game park drive through Kruger National Park the next day and wanted to make sure we were well rested.
