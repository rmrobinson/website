The fourth day of the tour started with an early morning wake up call. We woke up at 4:45 AM, got packed up and were having breakfast in the hotel restaurant shortly after 5:45 AM. We were in the lobby shortly after 6:15 and were loaded into the bus and on our way to the Cape Town International Airport at 6:30 AM sharp. Our flight to Durban, BA 6315, was scheduled to depart at 8:55 AM, and we made it to the airport with plenty of time to spare. After checking our bags we had exactly 1 hour before boarding, so Todd and I wandered around the terminal and then sat and read the news for a bit before boarding.

The flight pushed back from the gate 5 minutes early, and a short while later we were airborne. The flight was scheduled to take 1 hour 45 minutes, and shortly after takeoff the cabin crew came through with a breakfast of a bacon omlette. The food was fine, however we had eaten just three hours earlier and were not terribly hungry. The flight was uneventful with only mild turbulance, and we landed at the King Shaka International Airport in Durban shortly before 11. We collected our bags and picked up a sandwich for lunch, then boarded a new coach. We left the airport around 11:45 - some people took longer getting food than others.

We were only on the road for about 15 minutes before the bus pulled off the highway at the Westbrook beach. This beach, located right on the Indian Ocean, gave us fantastic views of the water and a chance to take in the warmth of the Durban area. We had 15 minutes to explore the beach, take some photos, and dip our hands into the warm waters of the Indian Ocean before we were back on the bus. We pulled away from the beach just before 12:30 PN and continued onwards.

Our destination, the St. Lucia estuary, was a 2.5 hour drive away, and the bus made good time on the trip. We ate the sandwiches we had picked up at the airport, took in the scenery, and had a history lesson as Belinda told us about the different tribes that live in the area, how they were named and some of the history in the area. I dozed off for a bit and got a bit into a book, Death's End by Cixin Liu. We pulled into the estuary shortly after 3 PM, disembarked and transferred to a river boat docked by the road.

This was the start of our river cruise around the St. Lucia estuary. As soon as we got onto the boat we were able to spot some hippos on the opposite shore, and once everyone was onboard and the lines were cast off we motored over to the hippos for a closer look. We saw several crashes of hippopotamuses in the river before we saw a pair of crocodiles sunning themselves on the shore. We continued on and saw another crocodile, then proceeded up the river. We saw several more crashes of hippos, playing around, always with a single dominant male and several females, occasionally we saw what appeared to be younger hippos in the group. We saw another crocodile and an eagle in the trees before we came across a large crash of hippos on the shore. This was the first time we saw a hippo that wasn't submerged in the water, and they looked much larger than they did when only their head and part of their back was visible. The boat turned around at this point and we enjoyed a river cruise back to the dock as the sun was setting; we docked just after 5 PM and the sun had gone down below the horizon.

We drove to our hotel, the Protea Hotel in KwaMsane, and got to our room at about 10 to 6. We had dinner with some Americans right at 6, came back to the room and relaxed before retiring to bed at 8:30 PM. The next day was scheduled to start again at 5 AM and we wanted to be well rested.
