Our trip to Australia began around lunchtime on Saturday, May 18, 2019. We had scheduled a pickup with United Taxi at 12:15, and the driver was several minutes early. We had finished packing the night before, so we were ready and waiting to go. We got into the cab and had an uneventful drive to Pearson. The first leg of our trip was on Air Canada, and so we got out at Terminal 1 and proceeded to the US check-in section. We got our boarding passes automatically, but had to line up and wait to speak with an agent to get our bag tags. It turns out the agent simply had to confirm that our Australian visas had been properly processed, and once that was confirmed we were good to go. The security and customs lines were incredibly short, and we had lots of time once we were in the secure part of the terminal ahead of boarding. We had a late lunch at Walburgers, then paced around the terminal before boarding. The boarding process began on time, and being in Zone 2 we were on the plane quickly. It was an uneventful flight, it took off a bit late. I watched First Man, about Neil Armstrong, along with the comedy Tag. I finished the flight with some episodes of Brooklyn 99.

We had an easy connection in LAX, there was no need to go through security again, we were able to walk from Terminal 6 where we arrived to Terminal B, the International Terminal, in about 10 minutes. Two long tunnels and one high bridge later we were in the international section. It was fairly quiet, we walked from end to end and saw all the planes getting ready to reach across the globe. We had a quick dinner at Starbucks, and then continued wandering. We knew we had a long way to go and wanted our legs to be nice and stretched.

We boarded QF12, an Airbus A380, quickly and uneventfully. We were in Row 68, which sounds like it is right at the back but we were actually overwing. We ended up pushing back about an hour late due to expected fog and potential re-fuelling required, however once we were in the air the flight was uneventful. We almost got missed by the dinner crew as they were serving food, but Todd was able to flag someone down. We spent about 10 hours dozing off and on - they kept the lights dimmed for the majority of the flight which made this easy. We were served breakfast a couple hours before landing, and then I watched Captain America - Winter Soldier and spent about an hour reading.

We disembarked, cleared customs and immigration with no issues, and were out around 8:30. It was a bit later than expected due to the delay in LAX, but it was a beautiful morning.
