This was a travel day for us. After a bit of a sleep in we got up, cleaned up, finished packing and headed to the Cairns airport via an Uber. We arrived shortly before 9:00, and we checked in and cleared security without any delays. We grabbed a quick breakfast at the airport, then settled into a couple of comfy chairs and waited for boarding to commence. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 10:55, so we had lots of time before our flight. I went through the photos on my camera and began deleting duplicate or blurry photos, while Todd read. Our flight ended up being delayed by about 15 minutes due to the late arrival of the inbound aircraft, but it wasn't a big deal, and shortly after 11:10 we took off.

I watched some TV on my phone during the flight, which lasted for roughly 3 hours. We landed at the Sydney domestic terminal shortly after 14:00, made a quick stop at the food court to grab a sandwich for lunch, then retrieved our bags and got onto the train. Our final destination today was Newcastle, where we were going to meet some of Todd's extended family. We boarded the T8 line towards Central station, and after arriving at Central we walked through the Southern Concourse before finding our way to Platform 9. This was the platform that the Central Coast & Newcastle Line (CCN) departed from. Our train was scheduled to depart at 15:15, and we got to the platform just after 14:45, so we had about 30 minutes to kill. We ate the lunch we had purchased at the airport and enjoyed the sunny weather while we waited. The train pulled into the station about 15 minutes ahead of its scheduled departure, so we boarded and found a place for our suitcases before settling in for the trip.

We were on the train for about 2 hours, passing through the scenic New South Wales countryside, before we reached our destination, Fassifern station. Here we meet Marilyn (Todd's first cousin, once removed) and her husband Jeff. They were waiting for us on the platform, and thanks to Facebook we knew what they look like! After some quick introductions we made our way to their car, and then took a quick 10 minute drive to their house. Here we had a lovely conversation with them both, we got to know them a bit better and share some stories of our travels so far, and then had a lovely meal with them. We turned in to bed around 22:00.
