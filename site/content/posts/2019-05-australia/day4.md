This was the first day of our scuba liveaboard! The dive shop had scheduled for us to be picked up shortly after 6:00, so at 5:15 we woke up, got packed up and checked out. We were waiting at the front of the hotel when the dive bus came to pick us up, right on time. It was a small minibus that held 11 people; we were the second group of people so there was still space but by the time we had picked everyone up the front of the bus was pretty packed. We were shuttled to the dive shop where final details were confirmed, then we loaded back up into the bus and got driven a couple blocks down to the pier where the boat we would be calling home for the next few days was docked.

After climbing aboard we were greeted with a breakfast of cold cuts, cut fruit and pastries. As we ate breakfast we got to meet some of the other people who were on the boat, as well as the crew. There was a short safety video we had to watch, and once that was complete the captain came down and gave us the pre-departure briefing. Our first dive site was about 35 knots away from Cairns, and given that the boat goes at about 10 knots/hour we had a bit of a trip to make it out to the reef. We learned that the weather was still a bit rough, and we were advised to take a seasickness pill as it was expected that things would get rough. Luckily Todd and I had each taken a Gravol before leaving the hotel, so we were prepared. The briefing complete we cast off, at 7:00 sharp.

The boat ride out to the first dive site was, as predicted, pretty rough. The first hour or so wasn't too bad, as the coast provided us a fair bit of protection from the winds, however once we turned out to sea the waves picked up. We spent the majority of the ride on the second deck, out at the back of the boat, so we had lots of fresh air and good views of the horizon. Several other guests joined us, and we got a chance to get to know some of the other divers a bit better. We had a pleasant chat with several guys as the boat rocked and rolled through the waves. There were times I felt that we were probably at a 45 degree angle to the horizontal, but in reality it probably wasn't that extreme. We did have to hold on to the benches at all times lest we lose our balance while seated. We made it to the first dive site, on Milln Reef, shortly after 10:30. We went down to the main deck and got organized. There were two ladies who were also completing their open-water checkout dives that were paired up with us, and our instructor introduced herself to us all as Elena. We went through a quick pre-dive briefing, then got our equipment setup and put on all our gear. The water was not going to be cold, but we donned stinger suits to help provide protection against jellyfish. We learned that this is stinger season, so the suits aren't really treated as optional. We got into the water just after 11:00, and began our first of four checkout dives. We descended to about 10 m, and then performed several of the basic skills we had learned in the pool. The first skills we reviewed were clearing a partially flooded mask, and recovering a lost regulator, both of which went smoothly. We then spent the remainder of our time underwater swimming amongst the coral and fish. We saw a Kuhl's stingray, some Dory fish, and a bunch of coral. One interesting difference between our course and this dive was that everything was being done in metric, while all our training was conducted using Imperial measurements. The change wasn't a major one, it just required some basic mental math to do the conversions. Once we had reached the end of our dive we conducted a 3 minute safety stop then ascended to the surface, where we did a couple basic surface skills. We came back onto the boat, took apart and then reassembled our gear, and then dried off and headed inside for lunch.

Lunch was sandwiches and fruit, and was quickly eaten. We didn't have much downtime as the next dive was scheduled for 14:00, so after a quick recap of the previous dive with our instructor we headed back onto the deck to get our next dive setup. We donned our stinger suits and our gear, then jumped into the water just at 14:30. This dive started with us performing the Controlled Emergency Surface Ascent (CESA) from a depth of 6 m, where you have to reach the surface without breathing while continually exhaling. Everyone got this successfully on the first attempt; this done we descended to the bottom and then performed a full mask flood clearing exercise. We also practised being out of air and using the secondary regulator from our buddy, which went smoothly. It is always a bit uncomfortable to not have the regulator in your mouth when you're 10 m under water, but we got through it pretty easily. These skills completed, we finished our time underwater with more exploration. We swam past an underwater coral formation that was shaped like a person-sized mushroom which was neat to see; we also saw a number of pretty fish. We ascended again after about 35 minutes, and then performed the tired diver tow while on the surface. This skill complete we headed back to the boat, took our gear apart and then reassembled it again, and had a quick break in the cabin of the boat where a tasty carrot cake was served. 

Since we were still completing our certification we didn't get to go out on the third dive of the day, and instead we were able to go out snorkelling. We were both a bit ambivalent about the opportunity as we weren't sure we'd see much that we hadn't already seen, but decided that we were here so we may as well go out. We got suited up in the stinger suits, and put on bright yellow shirts over top to increase our visibility from the boat, then jumped into the water shortly after 16:30. We swam away from the boat in the direction of our second dive, reaching the big mushroom-shaped rock outcropping. The water was too deep near the boat for us to really see anything, but as we got closer to the reef the coral was closer to the surface and we were able to see things pretty clearly. There were a few notable sightings during our snorkel - we saw a school of cuttlefish go by, we saw some very interesting orange fish that had a pair of Dr. Zoidburg-like feelers coming out around their mouths, and we saw some Dory fish swimming amongst the coral. We headed back when we saw the first group of divers climbing back aboard.

Dinner was served about thirty minutes after the conclusion of our snorkelling. It was delicious - chicken in a red Thai curry over rice, with some roasted carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower as sides. After dinner we got to socialize for a bit before there was a pre-dive briefing for the night dive. We hadn't completed our open water certification yet so we were not participating in this evening's night dive, but we will be joining the night dive tomorrow as we will have finished our course. The briefing showed some interesting things, such as how to signal air pressure remaining while using a flashlight and how to keep track of others underwater (hint: they give glowsticks to everyone to attach to their air tanks). We then relaxed a bit while the divers got geared up, and then watched the first part of the dive from the upper deck of the boat. We weren't able to see any sharks, but we did see some large fish swimming close to the boat.

The wind was fairly strong so we only stayed out for about ten minutes; after coming back inside I did a bit of reading while Todd did a bit of browsing. We called it an early night and were in bed by about 9:15 - it had been a long day and there was another long day ahead of us!
